# attentiveness_test

This is attentiveness test on python. On your screen will be printed number, and after 0.3 second will be deleted. Then you have to guess what number was.

I use ANSI escape code(standard for in-band signaling to control cursor location, color, font styling, and other options on video text terminals and terminal emulators).
